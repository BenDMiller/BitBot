# Project Description

The BitBot is a simple robotics/embedded systems project that utilized motor control, an accelerometer, and a gyroscope to control the movement of the bot. There are two parts to the robot. There is the main robot body, and the glove controller.

The main body of the robot is a cylinder with two wheels on either side (hence the name, BitBot). The body of the bot, as well as the wheels, were 3D modelled and printed using the Ender3 Creality 3D printer. The chassis for the controller of the bot was also 3D modeled and printed the same way. The controller is attached to a glove, and is used to determine the orientation of your hand in order to control the movement of the BitBot.

A video showing a basic overview can be found [here]().

Included in the Github Repoistory, there is simple documentation that can be referenced for questions. If more is desired, reach out and that can be updated.

# DISCLAIMER

Not all of the wiring has been completely updated. The documentation provided has some schematics, and they mostly match the proper circuitry, but there are a few changes. If there is difficulty determining the proper circuit design using the designated parts provided, reach out and that can be updated.
